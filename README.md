# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse
🖐️ Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse Control the computer / Laptop using hand gestures detected through the webcam! This Python project uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI to turn your hand into a virtual mouse — including features like mouse movement, click, volume control, brightness adjustment, and scroll.



🚀 Features
👆 Cursor control using index finger

✌️ Mouse click using index and middle finger together

🔊 Volume control using thumb and index finger distance

💡 Screen brightness control with thumb and pinky gesture

📜 Scrolling using hand gestures

🎯 Real-time performance with hand landmark detection (MediaPipe)

🚀 Getting Started
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gesture-virtual-mouse.git
cd gesture-virtual-mouse

# 2. Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the Python script

✨ How It Works
- Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks
- 
- Maps finger positions to screen coordinates
- 
- Measures finger distance to trigger actions like click, volume, brightness, and scroll



⚠️ Requirements
A webcam

Windows OS (for volume & brightness control compatibility)

Python 3.7+
